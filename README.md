# About

Hi! 👋🏾

This a custom slide made with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Navigation through slides can be done by controls (thumbnails and arrows) or by dragging the images

### What did I learn? 🤔

In this project I learned about classes in JavaScript, how to calculate element position in DOM and about debounce. The slide is a generic class and can be easily used in different projects

### Wanna play with this? 🤘🏾

Just clone the repository and open **index.html** file in your browser
